# Course Summaries and Study Materials  

This repository contains summaries, notes, and study materials from a selection of courses that I took throughout my studies. Each folder corresponds to a different course and includes structured summaries in **PDF and Word formats**, allowing for easy reference and modification. Some courses also contain **Anki flashcard decks** for efficient memorization of key concepts.  

These documents are intended as a **resource for reviewing and consolidating course material** rather than exhaustive lecture transcriptions. Feel free to explore and modify the Word versions to adapt them to your needs.
